        <p>Hello! I'm Robben. I am a graduate student in Fluids and Thermal Sciences at Brown University, where I'm advised by Professor Jesse Ault. My research topic is electrokinetic phenomena in microfluidic contexts; specifically, I investigate fluid, solute, and colloidal particle dynamics in gradients of solute concentration.</p>
        <p>I expect to finish my graduate studies around October 2024. I am open to discussions about career opportunities beginning in late 2024. Please contact me at <span class="mail-container"><span class="mail-inner">first name</span>_<span class="mail-inner">last name</span>&#64;<!-- Useless comment to deter bots -->&#98;&#114;&#111;&#119;&#110;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;</span> (please make the substitutions with my name as given above and note the underscore; this helps reduce the number of messages I get from robots).</p>
        <p class="pronunciation"><span class="multiline-container"><span><img src="images/pronunciation.svg" class="inline-image" /></span><span>My first name is pronounced "robin," like the bird.

My project includes theoretical and numerical explorations of electrokinetic phenomena in microfluidic contexts.

The latter describes the motion of fluid near charged boundaries, while the former involves the consequent motion of colloidal particles.</p>

              <p class="explanation">We examine, by way of experiments, theory, and numerical simulations, the three-dimensional dynamics of fluid, solute, and particles in merging streams of distinct solute concentration. We demonstrate that the sense of solute concentration-dependent particle migration can change near charged surfaces as a result of diffusioosmotic flow, resulting in flow recirculation regions we call "convection rolls."</p>
              <p class="explanation">I performed numerical simulations, analyzed experimental results, produced figures, and wrote the manuscript. Dr. Guillaume Durey performed experiments. Dr. Jesse Ault derived the theoretical solution for the dynamics and supported the project with funding and advising. We are grateful to Viet Sang Doan and Dr. Sangwoo Shin (University at Buffalo) for zeta potentiometry measurements used in this work. Part of this research was conducted using computational resources and services at the Center for Computation and Visualization, Brown University; travel to APS DFD was supported in part by a Conference Travel Fund award from the Brown University Graduate School.</p>

Users in high-performance computing environments can misunderstand the role of login nodes and run computationally intensive work that may affect the responsiveness or availability of shared resources.
