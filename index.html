My project includes theoretical and numerical explorations of electrokinetic phenomena in microfluidic contexts.

The latter describes the motion of fluid near charged boundaries, while the former involves the consequent motion of colloidal particles.</p>

              <p class="explanation">We examine, by way of experiments, theory, and numerical simulations, the three-dimensional dynamics of fluid, solute, and particles in merging streams of distinct solute concentration. We demonstrate that the sense of solute concentration-dependent particle migration can change near charged surfaces as a result of diffusioosmotic flow, resulting in flow recirculation regions we call "convection rolls."</p>
